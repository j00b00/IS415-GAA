# 1.0 Getting Started

## 1.1 The analytical question

In spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local government and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province. Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be “is there sign of spatial clustering?”. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be “where are these clusters?”

In this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.

## 1.2 The Study Area and Data

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

Hunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format. Hunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.

## 1.3 Install and Load R packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse, dplyr)
```

# 2 Getting Data into R environment

## 2.1 Importing shape file into r environment

Uses st_read() of sf package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be simple features Object of sf.

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")
```

## 2.2 Importing csv file into environment

Import Hunan_2012.csv into R by using read_csv() of readr package. The output is R data frame class.

```{r}
hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```

## 2.3 Performing relational join

Update the attribute table of hunan’s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of hunan2012 dataframe. This is performed by using left_join() of dplyr package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan,hunan2012) %>%
  dplyr::select(1:4, 7, 15)
```

## 2.4 Visualising Regional Development Indicator

Prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using qtm() of tmap package.

```{r}
equal <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC",
          n = 5,
          style = "equal") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Equal interval classification")

quantile <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC",
          n = 5,
          style = "quantile") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Equal quantile classification")

tmap_arrange(equal, 
             quantile, 
             asp=1, 
             ncol=2)
```

# 3.0 Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation

Compute global spatial autocorrelation statistics and to perform spatial complete randomness test for global spatial autocorrelation.

## 3.1 Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights

First, need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.

spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a “queen” argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don’t specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.

More specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan, 
                queen=TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

Summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.

## 3.2 Row-standardized weights matrix

Next,need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. Each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values.For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.

```{r}
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                   style="W", 
                   zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

# 4 Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation: Moran’s I

## 4.1 Maron’s I test

Perform Moran’s I statistics testing by using moran.test() of spdep.

```{r}
moran.test(hunan$GDPPC, 
           listw=rswm_q, 
           zero.policy = TRUE, 
           na.action=na.omit)
```

## 4.2 Computing Monte Carlo Moran’s I Performs permutation test for Moran’s I statistic by using moran.mc() of spdep. A total of 1000 simulation will be performed.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm= moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC, 
                listw=rswm_q, 
                nsim=999, 
                zero.policy = TRUE, 
                na.action=na.omit)
bperm
```

## 4.3 Visualising Monte Carlo Moran’s I

Examine the simulated Moran’s I test statistics in greater detail. This can be achieved by plotting the distribution of the statistical values as a histogram

In the code chunk below hist() and abline() of R Graphics are used.

```{r}
mean(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
var(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
summary(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, 
     freq=TRUE, 
     breaks=20, 
     xlab="Simulated Moran's I")
abline(v=0, 
       col="red") 
```

# 5 Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation: Geary’s C

## 5.1 Geary’s C test

Performs Geary’s C test for spatial autocorrelation by using geary.test() of spdep.

```{r}
geary.test(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q)
```

## 5.2 Computing Monte Carlo Geary’s C

Performs permutation test for Geary’s C statistic by using geary.mc() of spdep.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm=geary.mc(hunan$GDPPC, 
               listw=rswm_q, 
               nsim=999)
bperm
```

## 5.3 Visualising Monte Carlo Geary’s C Plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of the simulated values

```{r}
mean(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
var(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
summary(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, freq=TRUE, breaks=20, xlab="Simulated Geary c")
abline(v=1, col="red") 
```

# 6.0 Spatial Correlogram

Spatial correlograms are great to examine patterns of spatial autocorrelation in your data or model residuals. They show how correlated are pairs of spatial observations when you increase the distance (lag) between them - they are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran’s I or Geary’s c) against distance.Although correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.

## 6.1 Compute Moran's coorelogram

sp.correlogram() of spdep package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used in Moran’s I. The plot() of base Graph is then used to plot the output.

```{r}
MI_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          hunan$GDPPC, 
                          order=6, 
                          method="I", 
                          style="W")
plot(MI_corr)
```

Plotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation. This is because not all autocorrelation values are statistically significant. Hence, it is important for us to examine the full analysis report by printing out the analysis results as in the code chunk below.

```{r}
print(MI_corr)
```

## 6.2 Compute Geary’s C correlogram and plot

sp.correlogram() of spdep package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used in Geary’s C. The plot() of base Graph is then used to plot the output.

```{r}
GC_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          hunan$GDPPC, 
                          order=6, 
                          method="C", 
                          style="W")
plot(GC_corr)
```

Similar to the previous step, we will print out the analysis report

```{r}
print(GC_corr)
```

# 7.0 Cluster and Outlier Analysis

Local Indicators of Spatial Association or LISA are statistics that evaluate the existence of clusters in the spatial arrangement of a given variable. For instance if we are studying cancer rates among census tracts in a given city local clusters in the rates mean that there are areas that have higher or lower rates than is to be expected by chance alone; that is, the values occurring are above or below those of a random distribution in space.

## 7.1 Computing local Moran’s I

the localmoran() function of spdep will be used. It computes Ii values, given a set of zi values and a listw object providing neighbour weighting information for the polygon associated with the zi values.

The code chunks below are used to compute local Moran’s I of GDPPC2012 at the county level.

```{r}
fips <- order(hunan$County)
localMI <- localmoran(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q)
head(localMI)
```

localmoran() function returns a matrix of values whose columns are:

Ii: the local Moran’s I statistics E.Ii: the expectation of local moran statistic under the randomisation hypothesis Var.Ii: the variance of local moran statistic under the randomisation hypothesis Z.Ii:the standard deviate of local moran statistic Pr(): the p-value of local moran statistic The code chunk below list the content of the local Moran matrix derived by using printCoefmat().

```{r}
printCoefmat(data.frame(
  localMI[fips,], 
  row.names=hunan$County[fips]),
  check.names=FALSE)
```

### 7.1.1 Mapping the local Moran’s I

Before mapping the local Moran’s I map, it is wise to append the local Moran’s I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunks below can be used to perform the task. The out SpatialPolygonDataFrame is called hunan.localMI.

```{r}
hunan.localMI <- cbind(hunan,localMI) %>%
  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)
```

### 7.1.2 Mapping local Moran’s I values Using choropleth mapping functions of tmap package, we can plot the local Moran’s I values by using the code chinks below.

```{r}
tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Ii", 
          style = "pretty",
          palette = "RdBu",
          title = "local moran statistics") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

### 7.1.3 Mapping local Moran’s I p-values

The choropleth shows there is evidence for both positive and negative Ii values. However, it is useful to consider the p-values for each of these values, as consider above.

The code chunks below produce a choropleth map of Moran’s I p-values by using functions of tmap package.

```{r}
tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Pr.Ii", 
          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),
          palette="-Blues", 
          title = "local Moran's I p-values") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

### 7.1.4 Mapping both local Moran’s I values and p-values

For effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.

The code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.

```{r}
localMI.map <- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Ii", 
          style = "pretty", 
          title = "local moran statistics") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

pvalue.map <- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Pr.Ii", 
          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),
          palette="-Blues", 
          title = "local Moran's I p-values") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

# 8.0 Creating a LISA Cluster Map

LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations color coded by type of spatial autocorrelation. The first step before we can generate the LISA cluster map is to plot the Moran scatterplot.

## 8.1 Plotting Moran scatterplot

Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.

The code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using moran.plot() of spdep.

```{r}
nci <- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,
                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), 
                  xlab="GDPPC 2012", 
                  ylab="Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012")
```

Notice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC.

## 8.2 Plotting Moran scatterplot with standardised variable

First we will use scale() to centers and scales the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.

```{r}
hunan$Z.GDPPC <- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %>% 
  as.vector 
```

The as.vector() added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that map neatly into out dataframe.

Now, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
nci2 <- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,
                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),
                   xlab="z-GDPPC 2012", 
                   ylab="Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012")
```

## 8.3 Preparing LISA map classes

The steps to prepare a LISA cluster map.

```{r}
quadrant <- vector(mode="numeric",length=nrow(localMI))
```

Next, derives the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and centers the spatially lagged variable around its mean.

```{r}
hunan$lag_GDPPC <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
DV <- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     
```

This is follow by centering the local Moran’s around the mean.

```{r}
LM_I <- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    
```

Next, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.

```{r}
signif <- 0.05
```

These four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories.

```{r}
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I>0] <- 1
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I<0] <- 2
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I<0] <- 3  
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I>0] <- 4      
```

Lastly, places non-significant Moran in the category 0.

```{r}
quadrant[localMI[,5]>signif] <- 0
```

In fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:

```{r}
quadrant <- vector(mode="numeric",length=nrow(localMI))
hunan$lag_GDPPC <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
DV <- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     
LM_I <- localMI[,1]   
signif <- 0.05       
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I>0] <- 1
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I<0] <- 2
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I<0] <- 3  
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I>0] <- 4    
quadrant[localMI[,5]>signif] <- 0
```

## 8.4 Plotting LISA map

Now, we can build the LISA map

```{r}
hunan.localMI$quadrant <- quadrant
colors <- c("#ffffff", "#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9", "#fdae61", "#d7191c")
clusters <- c("insignificant", "low-low", "low-high", "high-low", "high-high")

tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "quadrant", 
          style = "cat", 
          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], 
          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],
          popup.vars = c("")) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)
```

For effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.

The code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.

```{r}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

hunan.localMI$quadrant <- quadrant
colors <- c("#ffffff", "#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9", "#fdae61", "#d7191c")
clusters <- c("insignificant", "low-low", "low-high", "high-low", "high-high")

LISAmap <- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "quadrant", 
          style = "cat", 
          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], 
          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],
          popup.vars = c("")) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, 
             asp=1, ncol=2)
```

# 9.0 Hot Spot and Cold Spot Area Analysis

Beside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.

The term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings

## 9.1 Getis and Ord’s G-Statistics

An alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.

The analysis consists of three steps:

Deriving spatial weight matrix Computing Gi statistics Mapping Gi statistics

## 9.2 Deriving distance-based weight matrix

First, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.

There are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:

fixed distance weight matrix; and adaptive distance weight matrix.

### 9.2.1 Deriving the centroid

need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work. To do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation

To get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation \[\[\]\] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
```

We do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with \[\[2\]\].

```{r}
latitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
```

Now that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.

```{r}
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
```

### 9.2.2 Determine the cut-off distance

Firstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:

Return a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep. Convert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb(). Return the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise. Remove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().

```{r}
#coords <- coordinates(hunan)
k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))
k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))
summary(k1dists)
```

The summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.

### 9.2.3 Computing fixed distance weight matrix

Now, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using dnearneigh()

```{r}
wm_d62 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)
wm_d62
```

Next, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.

```{r}
wm62_lw <- nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')
summary(wm62_lw)
```

## 9.3 Computing adaptive distance weight matrix

One of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.

It is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
knn <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))
knn
```

Next, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.

```{r}
knn_lw <- nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')
summary(knn_lw)
```

# 10.0 Computing Gi statistics

## 10.1 Gi statistics using fixed distance

```{r}
fips <- order(hunan$County)
gi.fixed <- localG(hunan$GDPPC, wm62_lw)
gi.fixed
```

The output of localG() is a vector of G or Gstar values, with attributes “gstari” set to TRUE or FALSE, “call” set to the function call, and class “localG”.

The Gi statistics is represented as a Z-score. Greater values represent a greater intensity of clustering and the direction (positive or negative) indicates high or low clusters.

Next, we will join the Gi values to their corresponding hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan.gi <- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.fixed)) %>%
  rename(gstat_fixed = as.matrix.gi.fixed.)
```

In fact, the code chunk above performs three tasks. First, it convert the output vector (i.e. gi.fixed) into r matrix object by using as.matrix(). Next, cbind() is used to join hunan\@data and gi.fixed matrix to produce a new SpatialPolygonDataFrame called hunan.gi. Lastly, the field name of the gi values is renamed to gstat_fixed by using rename().

## 10.2 Mapping Gi values with fixed distance weights

The code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.

```{r}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

Gimap <-tm_shape(hunan.gi) +
  tm_fill(col = "gstat_fixed", 
          style = "pretty",
          palette="-RdBu",
          title = "local Gi") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, Gimap, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

## 10.3 Gi statistics using adaptive distance

The code chunk below are used to compute the Gi values for GDPPC2012 by using an adaptive distance weight matrix (i.e knb_lw).

```{r}
fips <- order(hunan$County)
gi.adaptive <- localG(hunan$GDPPC, knn_lw)
hunan.gi <- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %>%
  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)
```

## 10.4 Mapping Gi values with adaptive distance weights

It is time for us to visualise the locations of hot spot and cold spot areas. The choropleth mapping functions of tmap package will be used to map the Gi values.

The code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.

```{r}
gdppc<- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

Gimap <- tm_shape(hunan.gi) + 
  tm_fill(col = "gstat_adaptive", 
          style = "pretty", 
          palette="-RdBu", 
          title = "local Gi") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, 
             Gimap, 
             asp=1, 
             ncol=2)
```
